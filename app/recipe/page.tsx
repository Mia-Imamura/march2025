      <h3 className="text-center text-4xl">Step One</h3>
      <p className="text-centerS">
        Place the graham crackers in the bowl of a food processor. Process in
        pulses until the crackers are completely broken down into crumbs.
        (Alternatively: Place the crackers in a zip-top plastic bag and crush
        with a rolling pin.)
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center text-4xl">Step Two</h1>
      <p>
        Whisk the dry ingredients: Combine the graham cracker crumbs, flour,
        salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center text-4xl">Step Three</h1>
      <p>
        Beat the butter and sugars: With an electric mixer or in a stand mixer
        with a beater attachment, beat together the granulated sugar, brown
        sugar, and softened butter on medium speed until combined and thick, 30
        to 60 seconds. Pick out any large pebbles of hard brown sugar that you
        see. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center text-4xl">Step Four</h1>
      <p>
        Mix in the eggs and vanilla: Add the two eggs and vanilla to the
        butter-sugar mixture and beat at medium speed until no clumps or streaks
        remain, 10 to 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the
        beaters.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center text-4xl"> Step 5</h1>
      <p>
        Mix in the dry ingredients: Add the graham cracker and flour mixture all
        at once. Beat on low speed just until no more dry streaks of flour are
        visible, 20 to 40 seconds.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center text-4xl">Step Six Through Twelve</h1>
      <p>
        Mix in the chocolate: Add all of the chocolate chips or chopped pieces,
        and beat on low speed for just a few seconds until incorporated. Chill
        the dough: Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater. Cover the
        bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to three days. (Or
        freeze in individual scoops for up to 3 months.) Preheat the oven to
        375ºF: Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheet
        with silicon baking mats or parchment. I usually bake my cookies one
        sheet at a time to help them bake evenly. If you prefer, or are crunched
        for time, bake two sheets at a time with one sheet in the upper third of
        the oven and the other in the lower third of the oven. Scoop the dough:
        Use a medium cookie scoop (or a well-mounded tablespoon measure) to
        scoop the dough out onto one of the baking sheet. Space the cookies
        about 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies for 10 minutes,
        then remove from the oven. Gently press 3 to 4 mini marshmallows into
        the tops of each cookie. (See Recipe Note for more ways to tinker with
        when to add the marshmallows.) Return the cookies to the oven and bake
        for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the marshmallows look like puff balls
        and are just starting to melt around the bottom. The marshmallows will
        continue to melt after the cookies come out of the oven. Cool the
        cookies: Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, or
        until the puffed middles collapse down and the cookies have firmed a
        little. Transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
        Continue baking the rest of the cookies: Continue baking in batches
        until all the cookie dough and marshmallows have been used. Enjoy!
        Cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container with wax paper
        between the layers for up to a week at room temperature. The
        marshmallows may stick to the wax paper; just gently peel the paper away
        when removing the cookies.

      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Lightly butter and line an 8-inch by
        8-inch metal baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Melt the
        butter or make brown butter (brown butter adds a toasted flavor). To
        brown butter, add the butter to a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low
        heat. As the butter melts, continuously swirl it around the pan. It will
        melt, get a little foamy, and finally turn golden brown. Remove it from
        the heat when the butter is light brown and smells nutty. Whisk the warm
        butter into the brown sugar until blended. The mixture will look greasy
        and gritty. Set aside for a few minutes to cool. When the sugar and
        butter mixture is warm, not hot, add the egg, vanilla, almond extract
        (optional), and salt. Stir until smooth and ever so slightly lighter in
        color. Add the flour in two additions, gently folding it into the batter
        after each addition until you no longer see streaks of flour. Stir in
        the chocolate chips and any additional add-ins like nuts or dried fruit.
        Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. It just covers the bottom
        of the pan. The batter is very thick, so gently pressing the batter into
        the corners helps. Bake the blondies until the edges look dry and the
        middle looks shiny and slightly underbaked, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool to
        room temperature before removing from the pan — this step is essential
        and helps the blondies set. Cut into 16 squares. Don’t be surprised if
        the blondies have not risen much (they should be about 1/2-inch thick).
        These are intended to be dense, rich, and a little fudgy.
